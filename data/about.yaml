    DevOps Engineer with Linux, Kubernetes, Docker and Go experience.
    My long term goal is to work as a Robotics Engineer, because I love team work, I am hypercurious and I need to be challenged on a daily basis.
    To help me reach my objective, I am actively pursuing Coursera classes in Robotics and Machine Learning as well as writing small Rust program for my Arduino.
