  DevOps Engineer with Linux, Kubernetes, Docker and Go experience.
  I think what makes me different from other engineers, is that I work very hard to find innovative
  and effective ways to test my projects. I don't like leaving anything up to chance. 
  I also go the extra mile in an attempt to achieve "true" production-grade.
