  DevOps Engineer with Linux, Kubernetes, Docker and Go experience.
  My long term goal is to work as a Robotics Engineer, because I love team work, I am hypercurious and I need to be challenged on a daily basis.
  To help me reach my objective, I recently completed the Reinforcement Learning Specialization offered by Coursera and just enrolled in the Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree.
