Dear recruiter,

I am a French Canadian who recently relocated to Madison for a new job at Epic. I feel bad to be looking for a new job already, and I know it does not look very professional. The role is not what was described to me and I am not given the tool I need to succeed at writing great software; I am an unpriviledged Linux user on my own dev machine!

I am starting to realize that nobody does real development in the department and this is what I am passionate about. This is what I want to do at this point in my career. I want to become good with distributed architectures, microservices patterns and maintaining highly available services.

I read multiple blog posts from Auth0 and I think there are some highly qualified people on your team. I see myself as a very capable developer with a strong background in cybersecurity and linux. With a friend of mine, we founded a cybersecurity club at the university and received founding to participate in local CTFs (Hackfest & Northsec).

I think what sets me apart from other candidates is that I really am passionate about computer science. It is my day job but also one of my hobby. I contributed heavily to my 'archsugar' project on github since the beginning of the pandemic. Have a look at the dev branch. It is a golang CLI that runs ansible playbooks which help me completely bootstrap and maintain my Archlinux workstation.

I am also involved in a startup project with two of my friends back in Canada. We are just starting but have settled on AWS as our hosting platform, Golang as our main language, and Flutter to develop mobile friendly clients. We will deploy services to EKS (AWS Kubernetes).

I would appreciate if you were discreet about my application, as I feel really bad about this.

Thank you,
Samuel
