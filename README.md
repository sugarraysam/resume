# Resume

Generate my resume using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

It uses the [Aafu theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/aafu/) and deploys to [Github Pages](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) automatically using Travis CI.


# CI/CD

Thanks to this [blog post](https://cjolowicz.github.io/posts/hosting-a-hugo-blog-on-github-pages-with-travis-ci/)

Travis also has a [Github Pages deployment](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pages/) integration, but it requires generating an oAuth token for your main Github account. It is more appealing to use the bot technique as mentioned in the blog post.
